- Clean kubernetes BaseModel
- Using kubernetes python client, create script that submits to a kubernetes cluster

- Create a dockerfile
* ubuntu (any)
* runs cuda and cudnn  (must be clear how to change, any recent is fine to start) 
* runs pytorch  (must be clear how to change, any recent is fine to start) 
* installs packages with conda. Use wandb and jupyter
* runs on gpu (can vary number) 
* exposes a port wandb can run through, OR describes how to run wandb https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/docker
* mounts a volume

Any other notes you think would help are great. 

Cheers!
